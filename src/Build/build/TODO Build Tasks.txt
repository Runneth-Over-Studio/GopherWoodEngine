TODO: Build Tasks
	☑ Clean - Deletes the Debug or Release directories in the project bin directories.
	☑ Restore - Restores NuGet packages for the solution.
		☑ Process Images - If release, processes images readme, NuGet package, and documentation.
		☐ Version (if release, increment version number)
		☑ Compile Shaders - Compiles the SPIR-V shader binaries that get embedded into runtime.
			☑ Compile Projects
				☐ Analyze (Possibilities: StyleCop, DupFinder, Roslyn Analyzers, InspectCode)
				☑ Tests
				☑ Documentation - Uses docfx, with previously processed images, to generate the API documentation.
				☑ Package - If release, generate the NuGet package for the runtime using previously processed images and project properties.
				☐ Publish - When there is an editor project, and if release, create a deployable package. The runtime deploys as a NuGet package so publish is not needed for that.
				☐ Deploy - If release: 
					- Serve API documentation.
					- If NuGet package version changed, deploy to gallery and GitHub repo releases. 
					- If editor version changed, deploy to GitHub repo releases.)
